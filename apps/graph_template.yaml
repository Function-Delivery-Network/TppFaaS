# This is an example of the definition of a function graph that specifies the application structure. An application
# must have exactly one main function that serves as the entry point of the application and can have zero to
# multiple f functions whose execution times are simulated by sleep commands. A main or f function can call no, a
# single, or multiple functions in parallel after its execution is finished. All functions used in the function
# graph must be defined in the corresponding serverless.yaml.
#
#      main
#      /  \
#    f1   f2
#    |
#    f3

main:     # Function main calls function f1 and f2 in parallel.
- f1
- f2
f1:       # After function f1 has finished its execution, it calls f3.
- f3
f2: None  # Function f2 calls no function.
f3: None
